# Quicksilver SSH host indexer

I used this code back when Quicksilver ran on Tiger (Mac OS 10.4) - it
was pretty stable, but I can't make any guarantees that it will
continue to work for you.

It probably requires the QS frameworks to be installed (and I don't
know how to do that anymore, sorry).

Good luck.

You may be more interested in this thing that I've made in the meantime: [ssh_bookmarker](https://github.com/antifuchs/ssh_bookmarker) - automatically generate `ssh://` bookmarks from your SSH config&hosts files.
